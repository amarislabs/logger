## Intention

Amaris Labs is a personal community organization headed by [@yehezkieldio](https://github.com/yehezkieldio) with the goal of creating a place for various open-source software and other projects. We are dedicated to fostering an open, welcoming, and respectful community where individuals from diverse backgrounds can collaborate to build remarkable projects. Our goal is to create an environment that encourages creativity, collaboration, and mutual respect. We expect everyone involved to use common sense, be kind, and act in good faith, contributing positively to our community.


## Our Standards

We strive to create a space where:

- Everyone feels welcome, respected, and valued, regardless of their background, identity, or experience level. We celebrate diversity and recognize that it enriches our community.
- Contributions are encouraged and appreciated, whether they come in the form of code, documentation, design, or discussions. Every contribution, no matter how small, is vital to our collective success.
- Disagreements are seen as opportunities for constructive discussions rather than hostility. We value differing opinions and encourage healthy debate.
- Feedback is given respectfully and received with an open mind. We understand that constructive criticism is essential for growth and improvement.
- Harassment, hate speech, and toxicity have no place in our community. We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for all members.
- People should assume good intent in others, while also recognizing the impact of their words and actions. We encourage empathy and understanding in all interactions.
- Everyone takes responsibility for keeping discussions and interactions constructive. We are all stewards of this community and must work together to uphold its values.

## Unacceptable Behavior

While we value open discussion, we do not tolerate behavior that disrupts the community, including but not limited to:

- This includes any form of harassment, whether sexual, verbal, physical, or otherwise. We take all reports of harassment seriously and will act promptly.
- Any form of hate speech, discrimination, or personal attacks based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other characteristic is strictly prohibited.
- Doxxing, stalking, or any form of intimidation will not be tolerated. Everyone has the right to privacy and safety.
- Deliberate trolling, inflammatory comments, or sustained disruptions that hinder productive conversation are unacceptable.
- Unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate remarks create an unsafe environment and will not be tolerated.
- Publishing others' private information without consent is a serious violation of trust and privacy
- Engaging in or encouraging unethical, illegal, or harmful activities is strictly prohibited.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including online forums, chat rooms, and social media platforms. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. We expect all members to uphold these standards in every interaction, both online and offline.

## Enforcement & Consequences

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be handled in a fair and proportional manner, considering intent, severity, and impact. Possible actions include:

- A private or public warning may be issued to address the behavior and encourage improvement.
- Temporary or Permanent Bans Depending on the severity of the violation, individuals may face temporary or permanent bans from a repository or community space.
- Escalation In severe cases, we may escalate the issue to GitHub, social media platforms, or relevant authorities to ensure the safety of our community.
- Other Actions We reserve the right to take other actions deemed necessary to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all members.

## Reporting Concerns

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it confidentially by emailing [amarislabs@proton.me](mailto:amarislabs@proton.me) or at the organization discussion page.

When reporting an incident, please include:
- Your contact information
- Names of individuals involved
- Description of the incident
- Date and time of the incident
- Any relevant context or supporting materials
- Whether you would prefer to keep your report confidential

Reports will be reviewed promptly and confidentially, and we will do our best to ensure fair handling of the situation. We appreciate your courage in bringing concerns to our attention, as it helps us maintain a positive community.

## Conflict Resolution Process

When possible, we encourage community members to try to resolve conflicts directly and amicably:

1. Address concerns respectfully with the involved parties
2. If direct communication is unsuccessful, request assistance from project maintainers
3. Submit a formal report if the issue remains unresolved
4. The team will review the situation and determine appropriate actions
5. Actions will be taken as necessary to resolve the conflict and maintain community standards

## Final Node

At the end of the day, we urge everyone to use common sense, be a decent person, and assume others mean well. We’re here to build cool things together, and that only works in a space where people feel safe, respected, and valued. Let’s work together to create a thriving community that inspires innovation and collaboration, where everyone can contribute and grow. Thank you for being a part of Amaris!
